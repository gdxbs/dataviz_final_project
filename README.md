# Data Visualization and Reproducible Research

> Gregory Bateham.

The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.

## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find... an analysis of fuel consumption data to identify trends, compare vehicle characteristics, and visualize key findings related to fuel efficiency. The primary dataset used is `fuel.csv`.

## Project 02

In this project, I explored the audio characteristics of songs from the "All Billboard Summer Hits" dataset. My goal was to practice data wrangling and visualization to uncover the patterns that define a summer hit and to tell a story about how the sound of popular music has evolved over the decades.

(you can place your figures in the `figures/` folder and use the `![](path_to_picture)` option to add the pictures here)

## Project 03

In this project, I explored the factors that contribute to concrete compressive strength using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis focused on visualizing the complex, non-linear relationships between the concrete's ingredients (like cement and water), its age, and its final strength. By creating scatter plots with logarithmic scales and multi-faceted visualizations, I was able to effectively illustrate core civil engineering principles, such as the diminishing rate of strength gain over time and the critical importance of the water-to-cement ratio in achieving high-performance concrete.

### Moving Forward

Throughout this course, I've learned that data visualization is far more than creating pretty charts; it's a powerful tool for discovery and communication. The process of wrestling with data to find the right visual representation—like using a log scale to reveal a temporal trend or faceting plots to deconstruct a multi-dimensional relationship—has taught me how to uncover and tell compelling stories hidden within the numbers.

Moving forward, I plan to delve deeper into interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly and D3.js, allowing users to explore the data for themselves. I also want to refine my skills in data storytelling, focusing on how to build a clear and impactful narrative around a set of visualizations. Finally, I am committed to the principles of reproducible research, and I will continue to use tools like R Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks to ensure my work is transparent, credible, and easy for others to build upon.
